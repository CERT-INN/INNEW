# INNEW - INNovery Early Warning

## **INNEW most attacked endpoint CPEâ€™s list**

Attackers attempt to take over or breach endpoint devices on a daily basis for several reason such as tracking user activity, infecting the device with malware for ransom or connecting the device to a botnet. Quite often, especially within enterprises, the infected device is a starting point to move laterally and compromise other devices within the network.

With the free dashboard of INNEW we are planning to share - for the endpoint softwares provided below - the most critical vulnerabilities, where there is high urgency and high priority of addressing it as soon as possible, meanwhile get the list and use it at your convenience.

It's worth to note that these are just a few examples of commonly targeted client and mobile software, and there are many other types of software that may be vulnerable to attacks as well. We will try to keep the lists updated as much as possible.

**Desktop software commonly targeted by attackers:**

- **Operating System**: Microsoft Windows: Windows operating systems, such as Windows 10, are widely used on desktop and laptop computers. Apple macOS, is the operating system used on Mac computers. Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution known for its user-friendly interface and extensive community support and Debian is a stable and widely respected Linux distribution.
- **Web browsers**: Browsers are the primary way that most people access the internet, so it's no surprise that they are a popular target for attackers. Popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge are frequently attacked by malware, phishing attacks, and other forms of cybercrime.
- **Email clients**: Email clients like Microsoft Outlook and Apple Mail are also frequently targeted by attackers, who may exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Media players**: Media players like VLC Media Player and Windows Media Player are targeted by attackers due to vulnerabilities that could allow for remote code execution.
- **PDF readers**: PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat and Foxit Reader have also been targeted by attackers due to vulnerabilities that could allow for remote code execution or other forms of malware delivery.
- **Instant messaging clients**: Instant messaging clients like WhatsApp and Skype can also be targeted by attackers who may exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Protocols**: Access protocols like Remote Desktop, SSH, SSL also be targeted by attackers who may exploit severe vulnerabilities.

**Mobile software commonly targeted by attackers:**

- **Android operating system**: Android is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world, which also makes it a popular target for attackers. Malware can be disguised as legitimate apps, or attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system to gain access to sensitive data.
- **iOS operating system**: While iOS has a reputation for being more secure than Android, it is not immune to attacks. Malware can be disguised as legitimate apps, or attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Messaging apps**: Messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat are popular targets for attackers who may exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Mobile browsers**: Mobile browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox are also frequently targeted by attackers. Malicious websites can be designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser to gain access to sensitive data.
