# INNEW - INNovery Early Warning

**INNEW project**

To effectively protect a network, the cyber security professionals must stay informed about the threats and vulnerabilities, among the various tasks it is essential to monitor ICT security alerts relating to both current and future threats. There are many security organizations which provide intelligence, blog, feeds, conferences, however the methodology by which this activity is carried out has not changed much in recent years, but what has changed is the number of events delivered, which have grown exponentially. The reaction times available to respond to this large number of alerts are decreasing more and more, while the amount of data and infrastructures to protect remain high. Security professionals around the world are committed to better organizing their analysis and reporting of the numerous threats, in order to avoid wasting time as much as possible and address high-risk threats faster.
A possible workaround is at least assuring that important alerts for the owned assets don’t get lost in the noise, as that, the goal of this project is to develop a web application to increase the process efficiency for gathering and sharing the security alerts in order to keep the final users aware about all the warning and critical events they might have in the infrastructure under protection.
With the aim of making the activity of collecting and sharing alerts, warnings, or advisories more effective, the Innovery’s CERT (abbr. CERT-INN) has been designing a service called "INNEW (INNovery Early Warning)" from now on called simply INNEW which consists in identifying, analysing and sharing more easily and quickly the information of high-risk threats, with a customizable feature on specific Vendor, Product and Versions. This service will allows, through the analysis of public and private sources and reference communities, to provide promptly and clearly those who subscribe to the service with the necessary information to allow the management of cyber risk mitigation.

## INNEW Free Version:

A free istance of INNEW v1.0 will be released as soon as possible. The free version is shared within CERT/SOC communities and every users, upon registration via email, will be provided with access to a FREE dashboard where we will group all alerts related to the most threatened client applications, the so-called **Most Attacked Endpoint Software**.
It is dedicated to most exposed and widespread client-side applications, including mobile software. 
You will find all details, here on github, at **[IS-FREE]** (https://github.com/cert-inn/innew/is-free/).

## Features

Threat-related information is analysed, categorised and routed based on the resulting risk. In relation to the large amount of information, with the aim of avoiding waste of time as much as possible and addressing **higher-risk threats** faster, each alert is accompanied by one or more labels that characterise its priority, the presence of IoC, possible media attention, etc. Specifically, the alerts will be grouped and showed by means of the following three categories:

- **Urgent Alert Release**: category reserved for urgent alert released by vendors, to remedy vulnerabilities especially with medium to high severity.

- **Exploit Code Available**: category reserved for alerts relating to the availability of public or private tools that can be used to exploit serious vulnerabilities, especially for those that allow remote access.

- **Zero Day Vulnerability**: category reserved for reports relating to zero-day vulnerabilities for which an official patch has not yet been released and which worth to to monitor.
